# Disk layout for this machine.
#
# Encrypted: the whole filesystem lives inside a LUKS container, so the disk
# holds nothing readable when the machine is off. The passphrase is asked for
# in the initrd, before anything else exists.
#
# Reconstructed by hand after `--relayout` wrote it on the machine and the
# push that would have carried it here failed. The machine is the source of
# truth for what it actually has; this file was matched against it.
#
# One declaration, two uses: disko formats from it, and fileSystems is derived
# from the same tree - so what gets erased and what gets mounted cannot drift
# apart.
#
# Devices are named by id, not /dev/sdX: kernel names follow the order disks
# are found in, so adding a drive can silently repoint this at another one.
#
# Swap is zram plus a 8G swapfile on @swap, not a partition:
# zram first - compressed swap in RAM, costing no disk - and the file
# underneath it as headroom for pages that stop compressing well.
# Neither needs a stable resume offset, so both can be resized or
# dropped with a rebuild, unlike this file.
#
# Editing this after installing does not repartition anything. It describes a
# disk that already exists.
